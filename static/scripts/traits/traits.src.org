ombat traits focus on martial and physical aspects of
your character’s background. Faith traits focus on his
religious and philosophical leanings. Magic traits focus
on any magical events or training he may have had in his
past. And Social traits is both a catch-all category and
one that indicates what social class or upbringing your
PC had.
Combat Traits
These traits are associated with combat, battle, and
physical prowess; they give characters minor bonuses in
battle and represent conf licts and physical struggles in
the character’s backstory.
1 Anatomist: You have studied the workings of anatomy,
either as a student at university or as an apprentice
mortician or necromancer. You know where to aim your
blows to strike vital organs and you gain a +1 trait bonus
on all rolls made to confirm critical hits.
2 Armor Expert: You have worn armor as long as you
can remember, either as part of your training to become
a knight’s squire or simply because you were seeking to
emulate a hero. Your childhood armor wasn’t the real
thing as far as protection, but it did encumber you as
4
much as real armor would have, and you’ve grown used to
moving in such suits with relative grace. When you wear
armor of any sort, reduce that suit’s armor check penalty
by 1, to a minimum check penalty of 0.
3 Bullied: You were bullied often as a child, and you are
now constantly ready to defend yourself with your fists
when an enemy comes near. You gain a +1 trait bonus on
attacks of opportunity attack rolls made with unarmed
strikes. Note that this trait does not grant the ability
to make attacks of opportunity with your unarmed
strikes—you’ll need to take a level of monk, the Improved
Unarmed Strike feat, or some other similar power to
gain the use of this character trait. However, that doesn’t
prevent you from selecting this trait. You’ll simply not be
able to make use of it until a later point if you do.
4 Courageous: Your childhood was brutal, yet you
persevered primarily through force of will and the hope
that no matter how hard things might get, as long as you
kept a level head you’d make it through. You gain a +2
trait bonus on saving throws against fear effects.
5 Deft Dodger: Growing up in a rough neighborhood
or a dangerous environment has honed your senses. You
gain a +1 trait bonus on Ref lex saves.
6 Dirty Fighter: You wouldn’t have lived to make it out of
childhood without the aid of a sibling, friend, or companion
on whom you could always count to distract your enemies
long enough to do a little bit more damage than normal.
That companion may be another PC or an NPC (who may
even be recently departed from your side). When you hit
a foe you are f lanking, you deal an additional 1 point of
damage (this damage is added to your base damage, and
is multiplied on a critical hit). This additional damage is
a trait bonus.
7 Fencer: You trained long hours as a youth with blades,
either taking lessons in the genteel art of fencing from
tutors paid for by your parents or by being taken under
the wing of a disenfranchised fencer who may have
turned to a life of crime. You gain a +1 trait bonus on
attacks of opportunity made with daggers, swords, and
similar bladed weapons.
8 Killer: You made your first kill at a very young age and
found the task of war or murder to your liking. You either
take particular pride in a well-placed blow, or vile pleasure
in such a strike as you twist the blade to maximize the
pain. You deal additional damage equal to your weapon’s
critical hit modifier when you score a successful critical
hit with a weapon; this additional damage is added to the
final total, and is not multiplied by the critical hit multiple
itself. This extra damage is a trait bonus.
9 Reactionary: You were bullied often as a child, but never
quite developed an offensive response. Instead, you became
adept at anticipating sudden attacks and reacting to danger
quickly. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Initiative checks.
10 Resilient: Growing up in a violent neighborhood
or in the unforgiving wilds often forced you to subsist
on food and water from doubtful sources. You’ve built
up your mettle as a result, and gain a +1 trait bonus on
Fortitude saves.
Faith Traits
These traits rely upon conviction of spirit, perception,
and religion, but are not directly tied to the worship of
a specific deity. You do not need a patron deity to gain
a Faith Trait, as these traits can represent conviction in
one’s self or philosophy just as easily as they can represent
dedication to a deity.
1 Birthmark: You were born with a strange birthmark
that looks very similar to the holy symbol of the god you
chose to worship later in life. This birthmark can serve
you as a divine focus for casting spells, and, as a physical
manifestation of your faith, increases your devotion to
your god—you gain a +2 trait bonus on all saving throws
against charm and compulsion effects as a result.
2 Caretaker: As the child of an herbalist or an assistant
in a temple infirmary, you often had to assist in tending
to the sick and wounded. You gain a +1 trait bonus on
Heal checks, and Heal is always a class skill for you.
3 Child of the Temple: You have long served at a temple
in a city, and not only did you pick up on many of the
nobility’s customs, you spent much time in the temple
libraries studying your faith. You gain a +1 trait bonus
on Knowledge (nobility) and Knowledge (religion) checks,
and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill
for you.
4 Devotee of the Green: Your faith in the natural world
or one of the gods of nature makes it easy for you to pick
up on related concepts. You gain a +1 trait bonus on
Knowledge (geography) and Knowledge (nature) checks,
and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill
for you.
5 Ease of Faith: Your mentor, the person who invested
your faith in you from an early age, took steps to ensure
that you understood that what powers your divine magic
is no different than that which powers the magic of other
religions. This philosophy makes it easier for you to
interact with others who may not share your views. You
gain a +1 bonus on Diplomacy checks, and Diplomacy is
always a class skill for you.
6 History of Heresy: You were raised with heretical views
that have made it not only difficult for you to accept most
religious beliefs, but you also have had to live with the fact
that you or those you love were often treated as pariahs. As
a result, you have turned your back on religious teachings,
and as long as you do not possess any levels in a class that
grants divine spellcasting power, you gain a +1 trait bonus
on all saving throws made against divine spells.

Character Traits
7 Indomitable Faith: You were born in a region where
your faith was not popular, yet you never abandoned it.
Your constant struggle to maintain your own faith has
bolstered your drive; you gain a +1 trait bonus on Will
saves as a result.
8 Sacred Conduit: Your birth was particularly painful
and difficult for your mother, who needed potent divine
magic to ensure you survived; your mother may or may
not have survived. In any event, the magic infused you
from an early age, and you now channel divine energy
with greater ease than most. Whenever you channel
energy, you gain a +1 trait bonus to the save DC of your
channeled energy.
9 Sacred Touch: You were exposed to a potent source
of positive energy as a child, perhaps by being born
under the right cosmic sign, or maybe because one of
your parents was a gifted healer. As a standard action,
you may automatically stabilize a dying creature merely
by touching it.
10 Scholar of the Great Beyond: Your great interests as
a child did not lie with current events or the mundane—
you have always felt out of place, as if you were born in the
wrong era. You take to philosophical discussions of the
Great Beyond and of historical events with ease. You gain
a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history) and Knowledge
(planes) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is
always a class skill for you.
Magic Traits
These traits are associated with magic, and focus on
spellcasting and manipulating magic. You need not be a
spellcaster to take a Magic Trait (although several of these
traits aren’t as useful to non-spellcasters). Magic Traits
can represent a character’s early exposure to magical
effects or childhood studies of magic.
1 Classically Schooled: Your apprenticeship or early
education was particularly focused on the direct application
of magic. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Spellcraft checks,
and Spellcraft is always a class skill for you.
2 Dangerously Curious: You have always been intrigued
by magic, possibly because you were the child of a
magician or priest. You often snuck into your parent’s
laboratory or shrine to tinker with spell components and
magic devices, and often caused quite a bit of damage and
headaches for your parent as a result. You gain a +1 bonus
on Use Magic Device checks, and Use Magic Device is
always a class skill for you.
3 Focused Mind: Your childhood was either
dominated by lessons of some sort (be they musical or
academic) or by a horrible home life that encouraged
your ability to block out distractions to focus on the
immediate task at hand. You gain a +2 trait bonus on
concentration checks.
4 Gifted Adept: Your interest in magic was inspired by
witnessing a spell being cast in a particularly dramatic
method, perhaps even one that affected you physically
or spiritually. This early exposure to magic has made it
easier for you to work similar magic on your own. Pick
one spell when you choose this trait—from this point
on, whenever you cast that spell, its effects manifest at
+1 caster level.
5 Hedge Magician: You apprenticed for a time to a
craftsman who often built magic items, and he taught
you many handy shortcuts and cost-saving techniques.
Whenever you craft a magic item, you reduce the cost of
gp required to make the item by 5%.
6 Magical Knack: You were raised, either wholly or
in part, by a magical creature, either after it found you
abandoned in the woods or because your parents often
left you in the care of a magical minion. This constant
exposure to magic has made its mysteries easy for you
to understand, even when you turn your mind to other
devotions and tasks. Pick a class when you gain this
trait—your caster level in that class gains a +2 trait bonus
as long as this bonus doesn’t increase your caster level
higher than your current Hit Dice.
7 Magical Lineage: One of your parents was a gifted
spellcaster who not only used metamagic often, but
developed many magical items and perhaps even a new
spell or two—and you have inherited a fragment of this
greatness. Pick one spell when you choose this trait.
When you apply metamagic feats to this spell, treat its
actual level as 1 lower for determining the spell’s f inal
adjusted level.
8 Magical Talent: Either from inborn talent, whimsy
of the gods, or obsessive study of strange tomes, you have
mastered the use of a cantrip. Choose a 0-level spell. You
may cast that spell once per day as a spell-like ability.
This spell-like ability is cast at your highest caster level
gained; if you have no caster level, it functions at CL 1st.
The spell-like ability’s save DC is Charisma-based.
9 Mathematical Prodigy: Mathematics has always
come easily for you, and you have always been able to
“see the math” in the physical and magical world. You
gain a +1 bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge
(engineering) checks, and one of these skills (your choice)
is always a class skill for you.
10 Skeptic: Growing up, you were always around
magical effects to the extent that you realized that much
of it was smoke and mirrors. You gain a +2 trait bonus on
all saving throws against illusions.
Social Traits
Social Traits are a sort of catch-all category—these
traits ref lect the social upbringing of your character,
your background with high society or lack thereof,
6
and your history with parents, siblings, friends,
competitors, and enemies.
1 Adopted: You were adopted and raised by someone not
of your actual race, and raised in a society not your own.
As a result, you picked up a race trait from your adoptive
parents and society, and may immediately select a race
trait from your adoptive parents’ race. Race traits can be
found in Pathfinder Companion products—if you don’t
have access to a selection of race traits, it’s best to simply
pick a different social feat.
2 Bully: You grew up in an environment where the
meek were ignored and you often had to resort to threats
or violence to be heard. You gain a +1 trait bonus on
Intimidate checks, and Intimidate is always a class skill
for you.
3 Canter: You grew up among thieves and scoundrels,
and their unusual speech patterns and turns of phrase
don’t phase you in the slightest today as a result. Anyone
who attempts to use Bluff to deliver a secret message
to you gains a +5 bonus on his Bluff check. When you
attempt to intercept a secret message using Sense Motive,
you gain a +5 trait bonus on the attempt.
4 Charming: Blessed with good looks, you’ve come to
depend on the fact that others find you attractive. You
gain a +1 trait bonus when you use Bluff or Diplomacy on a
character that is (or could be) sexually attracted to you, and
a +1 trait bonus to the save DC of any language-dependent
spell you cast on such characters or creatures.
5 Child of the Streets: You grew up on the streets of a
large city, and as a result you have developed a knack for
picking pockets and hiding small objects on your person.
You gain a +1 trait bonus on Sleight of Hand checks, and
Sleight of Hand is always a class skill for you.
6 Fast-Talker: You had a knack at getting yourself into
trouble as a child, and as a result developed a silver tongue
at an early age. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff checks,
and Bluff is always a class skill for you.
7 Natural-Born Leader: You’ve always found yourself
in positions where others look up to you as a leader,
and you can distinctly remember an event from your
early childhood where you led several other children to
accomplish a goal that each of you individually could
not. All cohorts, followers, or summoned creatures
under your leadership gain a +1 morale bonus on Will
saves to avoid mind-affecting effects. If you ever take
the Leadership feat, you gain a +1 trait bonus to your
Leadership score.
8 Poverty-Stricken: Your childhood was tough, and
your parents had to make every copper piece count.
Hunger was your constant companion, and you often
had to live off the land or sleep in the wild. You gain a +1
bonus to Survival checks, and Survival is always a class
skill for you.
9 Rich Parents: You were born into a rich family,
perhaps even the nobility, and even though you turned to
a life of adventure anyway, you enjoyed a one-time benefit
to your initial finances and your starting cash increases
to 900 gp.
10 Suspicious: You discovered at an early age that
someone you trusted, perhaps an older sibling or a parent,
had lied to you, and often, about something you had taken
for granted, leaving you quick to question the claims of
others. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Sense Motive checks,
and Sense Motive is always a class skill for you.
