A small character creation WWW program for Pathfinder.

Using Angular, Bootstrap and in the future possibly
Node.js for serverside. The choices are just because
they are popular now and I'm trying to learn them 
more because I have to use them elsewhere.

This is done with old AngularJS and has quite a lot of 
weird stuff going on because of it.

You can see the code running with name vialeea-angularjs
at Azure site azurewebsites.net. Sorry no link here to 
prevent web crawlers to generate load to that one, but
just join the name and site with a dot and go.
